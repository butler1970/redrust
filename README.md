# RedRust Project Guide

## Overview

RedRust is a command-line client for posting to Reddit subreddits, with special support for accounts that use Google OAuth login. It supports environment-based configuration, allowing you to securely provide credentials without exposing them on the command line.

## Configuration

RedRust uses environment variables and `.env` files for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following variables:

```
# Reddit API Credentials
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
REDDIT_USERNAME=your_username_here
REDDIT_PASSWORD=your_password_here

# Reddit API Settings
REDDIT_USER_AGENT="redrust/1.0 (your_username_here)"
REDDIT_OAUTH_PORT=8080

# OAuth Tokens (if using manual token method)
# REDDIT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
# REDDIT_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token_here
REDDIT_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN=3600

# Reddit IDs for operations
# REDDIT_THING_ID=t3_post_id_here
```

The application will automatically load these variables from your `.env` file or from system environment variables.

## Build/Lint/Test Commands

### Using Cargo

```bash
# Build the project in debug mode
cargo build

# Build the project in release mode
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run linting with Clippy
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Format the code
cargo fmt
```

### Using Just

RedRust includes a Justfile with convenient commands for common operations:

```bash
# List all available commands
just
```
```bash
# Build the project
just build
```
```bash
# Run the tests
just test
```
```bash
# Check code formatting
just fmt
```
```bash
# Fix code formatting
just fmt-fix
```
```bash
# Run clippy linter
just clippy
```
```bash
# Show help
just help
```
```bash
# Fetch posts from a subreddit (positional parameters)
just posts 5 rust true  # Get 5 posts from r/rust in brief format
```
```bash
just posts 10           # Get 10 posts from Reddit frontpage in detailed format
```
```bash
# Fetch posts with named parameters
just count=5 subreddit=rust brief=true posts-named
```
```bash
# Create posts with different authentication methods
# (All credentials are loaded from environment variables)
just create subreddit "Post Title" "Post content"
```
```bash
just user-create subreddit "Post Title" "Post content"
```
```bash
just browser-create subreddit "Post Title" "Post content"
```
```bash
just token-create subreddit "Post Title" "Post content"
```
```bash
just api-create subreddit "Post Title" "Post content"
```
```bash
# Create posts with named parameters (more readable for complex commands)
just subreddit=rust \
  title="Post Title" \
  text="Post content" \
  create-named
```
```bash
just subreddit=rust \
  title="Post Title" \
  text="Post content" \
  port=8888 \
  browser-create-named
```

## Code Style Guidelines

This project follows the standard Rust style guidelines:
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Follow the official Rust naming conventions (snake_case for variables and functions, CamelCase for types)
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Document public API functions with doc comments
- Use Result for error handling with appropriate error propagation
- Limit line length to approximately 100 characters

## Authentication Methods

This project supports multiple authentication methods for the Reddit API:

1. **App-only Authentication** (no user context, read-only)
2. **Username/Password Authentication** (for standard Reddit accounts)
3. **Browser-based OAuth** (for any account, including Google OAuth)
4. **Script-app Authentication** (using Reddit API credentials)
5. **Manual Token Authentication** (for headless environments)

The recommended approach for posting is to use the Browser-based OAuth method with token persistence, which works with any Reddit account including those using Google OAuth.

## Token Storage

The application stores authentication tokens in the user's home directory at `~/.redrust/` to avoid requiring login for each use. Refresh tokens are used to automatically renew access when needed.

## Headless Environments

For headless environments without browser access, you have two options:

1. **Use the TokenCreate command**: Manually obtain tokens from Reddit elsewhere and provide them directly to the application. This is useful for server environments or automated scripts.

```bash
# Using cargo (credentials loaded from environment variables)
cargo run -- token-create --subreddit mysubreddit --title "My Post Title" --text "Post content here"
```
<button onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText('cargo run -- token-create --subreddit mysubreddit --title "My Post Title" --text "Post content here"')">ðŸ“‹ Copy</button>

```bash
# Using just (credentials loaded from environment variables)
just token-create mysubreddit "My Post Title" "Post content here"
```
<button onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText('just token-create mysubreddit "My Post Title" "Post content here"')">ðŸ“‹ Copy</button>

2. **Transfer token files**: After authenticating on a machine with a browser, copy the token files from `~/.redrust/` to the headless environment.

### Workflow for Headless Environments

Here's a typical workflow for using RedRust in headless environments:

1. **Initial Setup (on a machine with browser access)**:
   ```bash
   # Using cargo (with REDDIT_CLIENT_ID set in environment variables)
   cargo run -- browser-create --subreddit test --title "Test Post" --text "Test content"
   ```
   ```bash
   # Using just (with environment variables set)
   just browser-create test "Test Post" "Test content"
   ```
   
   This will create and store tokens in `~/.redrust/YOUR_CLIENT_ID.json`.

2. **Transfer tokens to headless environment**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the token file to the headless machine
   scp ~/.redrust/YOUR_CLIENT_ID.json user@headless-server:~/.redrust/
   ```

3. **Use on headless environment**:
   ```bash
   # Using cargo (tokens will be automatically loaded and refreshed)
   cargo run -- browser-create --subreddit mysubreddit --title "Headless Post" --text "This was posted from a headless environment"
   ```
   
   ```bash
   # Using just
   just browser-create mysubreddit "Headless Post" "This was posted from a headless environment"
   ```

4. **If token transfer isn't possible, extract tokens and use the environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Examine the token file to get the values
   cat ~/.redrust/YOUR_CLIENT_ID.json
   ```
   
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables with the extracted tokens
   export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   export REDDIT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
   export REDDIT_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
   ```
   
   ```bash
   # Using cargo
   cargo run -- token-create --subreddit mysubreddit --title "Headless Post" --text "This was posted using extracted tokens"
   ```
   
   ```bash
   # Using just
   just token-create mysubreddit "Headless Post" "This was posted using extracted tokens"
   ```
